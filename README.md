This program use neural networks for Regression.

It uses the [DeepLearning4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/) library, and a transform result CSV from the dataset taken from [the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

## Regression Neural Network

The [AirfoilRecognition](https://github.com/jfourmond/AirfoilRegression/blob/master/src/main/java/AirfoilRegression.java) class can be run in order to visualize and test your configuration, as the raw one has been chosen totally arbitrarily :
- Number of layers
- Number of hidden neurons per layers
- Number of outputs neurons per layers
- Learning Rate
- Activation Function
- Number of iterations
- Seed
- ...

Once launch, you can observe the evolution of your neural network at this url : [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
